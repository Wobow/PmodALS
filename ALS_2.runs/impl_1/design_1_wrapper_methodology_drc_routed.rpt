2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja_pin1_io relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja_pin2_io relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja_pin3_io relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on ja_pin4_io relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on usb_uart_rxd relative to clock(s) sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on usb_uart_txd relative to clock(s) sys_clock 
Related violations: <none>
